# What is this about?

These are notes about a hands-on exploration of James Shore's pattern language for testing. 

In the first edition of _The Mythical Man-Month_, Fred Brooks advised us to "plan to throw one away. You will anyway.‚Äù In the second edition, he revised that advice. Instead, he suggests we continually iterate. 

In that spirit, this is the second [iteration of my attempt to understand](iteration-1.md) James Shore's [pattern language for testing](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks). James offered considerable feedback on the first iteration of this exploration, and I feel as if I now have a better understanding of the model. The first iteration was clumsy for all the wrong reasons. Hopefully, this attempt will be clumsy for better reasons.
